# chiral-impulse
co-operative game
  You are a group composed of founders, explorers, & sojourners attempting to bring economic prosperity to your country & allies. Adorned with an array of coats, arms, & hats, You must dive into the vast cosmic deep, searching for artifacts and resources to fund your colonization complex. 

## Abstract Concepts
### Countries & Allience's
  Each Player must pledge to country. They may Ally with any other country of their choosing, but must take into consideration the downstream political effects. 
### Player Agency
  Each Player must balance the effects of their actions, not withstanding those of maximum harmony or dissonance. 
### Aviary
  Each Player must pledge to a bird house. 
### Monolith 
  recurring set of geometry within the game, represents themes of morality, reflection, and power

## Implemented Game Objects 
#### Globe
  Each Player starts at home. Earth.
#### Vessal
  A cynlindrical vessal composed of different submodules (capsul + cabin + propulsion).
#### SubStation
  A cynlindrical vessal composed of different submodules (cabins). Can house any player; however, each cabin can be configured to suite the needs of the player. Expressed as a series of linked cabins. 

#### [artifact_id][common_name][discovered_by]
- All artifacts are inviolable
- can interface with any player or artifact in a set range.

#### Dark
  _A programmed artificial caretaker that controls substation functionality. Linguists have spent decades attempting to decompile its image but little progress has been made_.
  - can carry long thought provoking conversations.
  - Has the same access privledge as a pilot.
  - tablet.

  #### Seer
  _An optical device that can be used to communicate with other seerstones over infinte rang with zero latency_.  
  - Monitors vast volumes. 
  - Must orbit the sphere to gain different pov.
  - Smaller stones have fixed positions** while larger ones have greater fov.
  - sphere. 

  #### Print
  _Player is equipped with a printstone. The relationsip between them is binding_.
  - contains a set of heuristic bits that are movable only by the owning player.
  - is capable of replicating itself over a set duration.
  - cube.

  #### Platonic
  _Printers can construct platonic stones, these are accounted for as bits by the printer_
   - A device that can relay interactions between artifacts and players
   - 5 configurations
